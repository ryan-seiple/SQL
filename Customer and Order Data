#In this SQL I queried data from an existing database containing multiple existing tables, where I then quantified data from the tables regarding customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?

select count (orderid) from BIT_DB0.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

select count (orderid)
from BIT_DB0.JanSales
where Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

select acctnum
from BIT_DB0.customers as cust
inner join BIT_DB0.FebSales as Feb
on cust.order_id=Feb.orderid;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

select distinct product, price
from BIT_DB0.JanSales
order by price asc limit 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
select sum(quantity)*price as revenue,product
from BIT_DB0.JanSales
group by product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

select sum(Quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
from BIT_DB0.FebSales
where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
group by product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than two products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

select count(cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
from BIT_DB0.FebSales as Feb
left join BIT_DB0.customers as cust
on Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
where Feb.Quantity>2;
